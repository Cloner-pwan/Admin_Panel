# Project: Admin Panel

## Configuration

- This project uses a localhost server and Tailwind CLI.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- When using this panel, the name you choose for items in the left panel **must exactly match the ID** of your content `<div>`s.
- **Do not change the structure of the `side_panel`**, as it is the basic version and may break the panel if modified.

## Current Ideas for Expansion

- Integrate an API to analyze and test the panel's full functionality (PHP is required; not possible with vanilla JS alone).
- Add testing endpoints and integrate APIs for experimentation
- Add different types of options, such as forms, login pages, and CRUD operations, to test AJAX and Axios thoroughly.
- Create a user profile and display it in the header.
- Add darkmode for better UI design.

## Version 1.0.0

- **v = 1.0.0**
- Very basic structure, works fine but not yet fully reliable.
- **Not recommended for large projects.**
